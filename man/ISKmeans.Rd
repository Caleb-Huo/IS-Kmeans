\usage{
ISKmeans(d, K = NULL, gamma = NULL, alpha = 0.5, scale = TRUE,
  group = NULL, nstart = 20, wsPre = NULL, penaltyInfo = NULL,
  sparseStart = TRUE, silent = FALSE, maxiter = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{combined data matrix n*J, where n is number of subjects, J=J1+J2+... and J1 is number of features in omics dataset 1 and J2 is number of features in omics dataset 2...}

\item{K}{number of clusters}

\item{gamma}{Penalty on total number of features. Larger gamma will yeild small number of selected features.}

\item{alpha}{balance between group sparsity and individual sparsity. alpha=1 yeilds no group sparsity. alpha=0 yeilds no individual penalty.}

\item{group}{Prior group information. Potentially these group can contain overlap features. group is a list and each element of the list is feature index.}

\item{nstart}{Number of initials for Kmeans for sparse Kmeans}

\item{wsPre}{Initial feature weight.}

\item{penaltyInfo}{only for the purpose of gap statitics. Here we will fix the penalty design to perform gap statistics. The input should be a list of groupInfo. See groupInfo for details.}

\item{sparseStart}{Use Sparse Kmeans to do initialization.}

\item{silent}{Output progress.}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum numbre of iteration between ws and Cs.}

\item{If}{scale the data to mean 0 and sd 1. By default, scale is TRUE.}
}
\value{
m lists, m is length of gamma parameters. Each list is consisting of
(ws=ws, Cs=Cs, objective=ADMMobject$objective, BIC=BIC, gamma=agamma,alpha=alpha
\item{ws}{weight for each feature. Zero weight means the feature is not selected.}
\item{Cs}{Cluster Assignment}
\item{objective}{objective value}
\item{obj0}{sum of weighted separation ability. This term is for the purpose of gap statistics.}
\item{groupInfo}{a list containing group design, alpha, gamma}
